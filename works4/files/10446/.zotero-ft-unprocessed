A paradigm case of these innate principles is the structure dependence of auxiliary inversion in complex polar questions (Chomsky, 1968, 1975, 1980). Computational approaches have focused on the properties of the input in explaining how children acquire these questions. In contrast, we argue that messages are structured in a way that supports structure dependence in syntax. We demonstrate this approach within a connectionist model of sentence production (Chang, 2009) which learned to generate a range of complex polar questions from a structured message without positive exemplars in the input. The model also generated different types of error in development that were similar in magnitude to those in children (e.g., auxiliary doubling, Ambridge, Rowland, & Pine, 2008; Crain & Nakayama, 1987). Through model comparisons we trace how meaning constraints and linguistic experience interact during the acquisition of auxiliary inversion. Our results suggest that auxiliary inversion rules in English can be acquired without innate syntactic principles, as long as it is assumed that speakers who ask complex questions express messages that are structured into multiple propositions.\n\n    Previous article in issue\n    Next article in issue\n\nKeywords\nLanguage acquisition\nSentence production\nSubject-auxiliary inversion\nPolar questions\nConceptual structure\nConnectionist modeling\nChoose an option to locate/access this article:\n\nCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.\nCheck Access\nor\nPurchase\nor\nCheck for this article elsewhere\nRecommended articles Citing articles ( 0 )\n\n☆\n\n    Hartmut Fitz is a member of the Language in Interaction Consortium at Radboud University Nijmegen.
