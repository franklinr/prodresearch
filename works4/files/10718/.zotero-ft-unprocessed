One reason for this is that previous studies did not factor out variation due to the different rules tested. To examine this issue, we reanalyzed grammaticality judgment scores in Flege, Yeni-Komshian, and Liu's (1999) study of L2 learners using rule-related predictors and found that, in addition to the overall drop in performance due to a sensitive period, L2 knowledge increased with years of input. Knowledge of different grammar rules was negatively associated with input frequency of those rules. To better understand these effects, we modeled the results using a connectionist model that was trained using Korean as a first language (L1) and then English as an L2. To explain the sensitive period in L2 learning, the model's learning rate was reduced in an age-related manner. By assigning different learning rates for syntax and lexical learning, we were able to model the difference between early and late L2 learners in input sensitivity. The model's learning mechanism allowed transfer between the L1 and L2, and this helped to explain the differences between different rules in the grammaticality judgment task. This work demonstrates that an L1 model of learning and processing can be adapted to provide an explicit account of how the input and the sensitive period interact in L2 learning.\nContinue reading full article\n\n    Enhanced PDF\n    Standard PDF (744.7 KB)\n\nAncillary\nRelated content\nArticles related to the one you are viewing\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view the related content of this article.\n\nThere are currently no results to show, please try again later\nCiting Literature\n\n    Number of times cited : 0\n\n    PDF\n    PDF\n    Info\n\nClose article support pane\n\n    Wiley\n\n    Browse Publications\n    Browse by Subject\n    Resources\n\n    Help & Support\n    Cookies & Privacy\n    Terms of Service\n\n    About Us\n    Wiley Job Network\n    Advertisers & Agents\n\nPowered by Wiley Online Library\n\nCopyright Â© 1999 - 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
