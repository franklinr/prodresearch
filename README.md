# Website references

Save references from zotero using better bibtex with files attached.  Save it in a folder called works4.

To update references, download git.  Replace works4 folder with newly created works4 folder.

Run latex2html.sh in the git folder.  It will scan the works4.bib and rename the files based on the articles and place them in the top level refpdfs folder.  It will also create the works4b.bib which has url links for these files.  It should load these files to the git.

Then copy and paste the html output from your browser into google sites.  Links should download files from github.
